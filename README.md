# Scraping Statcast Data

This small project is motivated by jldbc's _pybaseball_ (https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) and billpetti's _baseballr_ (https://github.com/BillPetti/baseballr) projects.  Unfortunately, _baseballr_ was last updated in May 2018 while Statcast continues to add new variables into the data set.  

For now, I focus the scope on downloading Statcast data.
